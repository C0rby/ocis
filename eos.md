OCIS can be configured to run on top of [eos](https://eos.web.cern.ch/). While the [eos documentation](http://eos-docs.web.cern.ch/) does cover a lot of topics it leaves out some details that you may have to either pull from various [docker containers](https://gitlab.cern.ch/eos/eos-docker), the [forums](https://eos-community.web.cern.ch/) or even the [source](https://github.com/cern-eos/eos) itself.

This document is a work in progress of the current setup.

## Docker dev environment for eos storage

### 1. Start eos & ocis containers

Start the eos cluster and ocis via the compose stack

```
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. LDAP support

Configure the os to resolve users and groups using ldap

```
docker-compose exec -d ocis /start-ldap
```

Check that the os in the ocis container can now resolve einstein or the other demo users

```
$ docker-compose exec ocis id einstein
uid=20000(einstein) gid=30000(users) groups=30000(users),30001(sailing-lovers),30002(violin-haters),30007(physics-lovers)
```

We also need to restart the reva-users service so it picks up the changed environment. Without a restart it is not able to resolve users from LDAP.
```
docker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis kill reva-users
docker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis run reva-users
```

### 3. Home storage

Kill the home storage. By default it uses the `owncloud` storage driver. We need to switch it to the `eoshome` driver and a new layout:

```
docker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis kill reva-storage-home
docker-compose exec -e REVA_STORAGE_EOS_LAYOUT="{{substr 0 1 .Username}}/{{.Username}}" -e REVA_STORAGE_HOME_DRIVER=eoshome ocis ./bin/ocis run reva-storage-home
```

### 4. Home data provider

Kill the home data provider. By default it uses the `owncloud` storage driver. We need to switch it to the `eoshome` driver and a new layout:

```
docker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis kill reva-storage-home-data
docker-compose exec -e REVA_STORAGE_EOS_LAYOUT="{{substr 0 1 .Username}}/{{.Username}}" -e REVA_STORAGE_HOME_DATA_DRIVER=eoshome ocis ./bin/ocis run reva-storage-home-data
```

{{< hint info >}}
The difference between the *home storage* and the *home data provider* are that the former is responsible for metadata changes while the latter is responsible for actual data transfer. The *home storage* uses the cs3 api to manage a folder hierarchy, while the *home data provider* is responsible for moving bytes to and from the storage.
{{< /hint >}}

### 4. Frontend files namespace

Restart the reva frontend with a new namespace (pointing to the eos storage provider) for the dav files endpoint

```
docker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis kill reva-frontend
docker-compose exec -e DAV_FILES_NAMESPACE="/eos/" ocis ./bin/ocis run reva-frontend
```

## Verification

Login with `einstein / relativity`, upload a file to einsteins home and verify the file is there using

```
docker-compose exec ocis eos ls -l /eos/dockertest/reva/users/e/einstein/
-rw-r--r--   1 einstein users              10 Jul  1 15:24 newfile.txt
```

## Further exploration

EOS has a built in shell that you can enter using
```
$ docker-compose exec mgm-master eos
